ArduinoMap
==========

Implementation of a Map data structure for Arduino.

[Alexander Brevig](http://alexanderbrevig.com/) created this library, called
"HashMap" in [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/).

http://wiring.uniandes.edu.co/source/trunk/wiring/firmware/libraries/HashMap/

[Joshua Yanchar](https://github.com/Syndic) renamed it to "ArduinoMap" given
that the implementation does not use hashing, and removed any references to
"hash."
